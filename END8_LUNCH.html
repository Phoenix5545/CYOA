  <p>
    You walk to the cafeteria and stand in line waiting to grab a tasteless plate of mush. As you shuffle forward, you hear your name called over the PA system. "Please report to the front office." You step out of line and trudge to the main office. Glancing up, you see your best friend swinging their car keys. "Hop in, we're getting lunch!"
