	  Fall Feet-First
  </h2>

    Qucikly rotating yourself around you point your feet toward the rocky water below you. As you fall you hear the distinct chopping sound of a helicopter. Looking around, you spot it just above the treeline. A moment later it spots you and shines a search light on your falling form.
