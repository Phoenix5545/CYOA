    Leaping from your chair, you pull your lighter from your back pocket. Swiftly lighting it, you set fire to your notebook and throw it on the flamable carpet. Running from the room, you see smoke billowing from the door. As you burst outside you start running. Just as you are crossing a very tall bridge, you are stopped by a police officer.
