	  Fake Your Death
  </h2>

  <p>
    You plunge into the freezing water with an audible splash. Your momentum combined with the force of the waterfall pushes you straight to the plant-covered riverbed. Thinking quickly, you grab hold of the slimy weeds and focus on your full lungs. You crawl hand over hand along the bottom of the river, making your final escape. Presumed dead, you are free to do as you like. Oh the fun you will have.
