    Running into the hallway, you are quickly engulfed by darkness. Unable to slow down, you push ahead. Unable to see in the absolute darkness, you trip over something left in the hall. Your teacher is upon you in an instant and grabs hold of your ankle. One scream and a hulk smash latter, you strongly resemble a shattered jelly jar. Puny God.
