	  Apologize
  </h2>

  <p>
    Blinking the tears out of your eyes, you do your best to make eye contact. "I'm really sorry miss," you said quietly, "My pencil snappedd and I didn't want to disturb the class." She eyes you up and down coldly, and you swallow hard. Then her face breaks into a smile. "I really appreciate your consideration," she laughed, "Keep up the good work!" You walk away and take a deep breath in through your nose, never having appreciated fresh air more in your life.
